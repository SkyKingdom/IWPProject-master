IWP Project VisioLab 2021

Unity Version: 2020.3.6f1

The most important thing to keep in mind is to download and install the Oculus App on your device.
This project has been made with the usage of an Oculus Quest 2 in mind, and utilizes the Unity XR Toolkits that can be found in the Package Manager.
These packages should already get resolved on install when the project is first opened.

Once you have opened the project, make sure that the Oculus App is running, and has a connection to your device.
Then it should just be a matter of pressing Play in the Unity Editor, and the Oculus Quest (2) should be able to pick up the signal and start running the app.

A walkthrough of the app can be found among the project documents, which is detailed on the flowchart of the bunsen burner experiment, which has been attached in the Appendix of the main research document.

For any questions or remarks, please contact the main developer of the project: krisgalama@gmail.com
